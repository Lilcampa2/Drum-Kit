# Drum-Kit
## Using JavaScript I made a drum kit that if you press on either the keyboard of your computer or you use your mouse then the sound of the instrument will make the appropriate sound.

## I also added alittle animation to it by changing the opacity of the instruments when your click on them combined with the setTimeOut function by adding the class and removing it with a 1 second time delay between each press.
